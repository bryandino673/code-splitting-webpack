index.js: Main entry point of the application. It dynamically imports page1.js and page2.js when corresponding buttons are clicked.
page1.js: JavaScript file for Page 1.
page2.js: JavaScript file for Page 2.
dist/: Contains the built output files.
index.html: HTML file to serve as the entry point of the application.
main.js: Bundled JavaScript file generated by Webpack.
