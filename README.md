- `index.js`: Main entry point of the application buttons are clicked.
- `page1.js` and `page2.js`: When corresponding buttons are clicked.
- `page1.js`: JavaScript file for Page 1.
- `page2.js`: JavaScript file for Page 2.
- `dist/`: Contains the built output files.
- `Ã¬ndex.html`: HTML file to serve as the enrty piont of the application.
- `main.js`: Bundled Javascript file generated by Webpack.
